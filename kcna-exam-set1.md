## EXAM KCNA TOPIC 1 QUESTION 51 DISCUSSION

**Question #: 51**
**Topic #: 1**

How are ReplicaSets and Deployments related?

A. Deployments manage ReplicaSets and provide declarative updates to Pods.
B. ReplicaSets manage stateful applications, Deployments manage stateless applications.
C. Deployments are runtime instances of ReplicaSets.
D. ReplicaSets are subsets of Jobs and CronJobs which use imperative Deployments.

**Correct Answer: A**

**Explanation:**
Deployments are higher-level abstractions in Kubernetes that manage ReplicaSets. ReplicaSets, in turn, are lower-level controllers responsible for maintaining a specified number of identical Pods to ensure high availability and fault tolerance. Deployments use ReplicaSets to manage the lifecycle of Pods, including scaling, rolling updates, and maintaining a desired number of replicas, providing declarative updates to Pods.

**Question #: 52**
**Topic #: 1**

What factors influence the Kubernetes scheduler when it places Pods on nodes?

A. Pod memory requests, node taints, and Pod affinity.
B. Pod labels, node labels, and request labels.
C. Node taints, node level, and Pod priority.
D. Pod priority, container command, and node labels.

**Correct Answer: A**

**Explanation:**
The Kubernetes scheduler takes into account several factors when placing Pods on nodes:
*   **Pod Memory Requests:** The scheduler considers the resource requests (CPU and memory) specified for the Pod to ensure the node has sufficient resources.
*   **Node Taints:** Nodes can be "tainted" to repel certain Pods. The scheduler checks for taints on nodes and tolerations on Pods to determine if a Pod can be scheduled on a particular node.
*   **Pod Affinity and Anti-Affinity:** These rules specify whether certain Pods should be placed on the same node or close to each other (affinity), or should not be placed on the same node or close to each other (anti-affinity).

## EXAM KCNA TOPIC 1 QUESTION 43 DISCUSSION

**Question #: 43**
**Topic #: 1**

Kubernetes supports multiple virtual clusters backed by the same physical cluster. These virtual clusters are called:

A. namespaces
B. containers
C. hypervisors
D. cgroups

**Correct Answer: A**

**Explanation:**
Namespaces in Kubernetes are virtual clusters that provide resource isolation, access control, and organization within a single physical cluster. They allow multiple teams or projects to share the same physical cluster without interfering with each other. Each namespace has its own set of resources, configurations, and access controls.

**Question #: 44**
**Topic #: 1**

What component enables end users, different parts of the Kubernetes cluster, and external components to communicate with one another?

A. kubectl
B. AWS Management Console
C. Kubernetes API
D. Google Cloud SDK

**Correct Answer: C**

**Explanation:**
The Kubernetes API (Application Programming Interface) is the central component that enables communication between end users (via tools like `kubectl`), different parts of the Kubernetes cluster (e.g., controllers, schedulers), and external components. It provides a unified HTTP RESTful interface for interacting with the cluster, allowing users and components to create, update, delete, and retrieve Kubernetes resources.

Which command will list the resource types that exist within a cluster?

A. kubectl api-resources
B. kubectl get namespaces
C. kubectl api-versions
D. curl https://kubectrl/namespaces

**Correct Answer: A**

**Explanation:**
The `kubectl api-resources` command displays a list of all resource types that are available in the Kubernetes API. This includes both built-in resources (like Pods, Services, Deployments) and custom resources that may be defined by Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs).

**Topic #: 1**

Which of these components is part of the Kubernetes Control Plane?

A. coredns
B. cloud-controller-manager
C. kube-proxy
D. kubelet

**Correct Answer: B**

**Explanation:**
The Kubernetes Control Plane consists of several key components:
*   **kube-apiserver:** Exposes the Kubernetes API.
*   **etcd:** Consistent and highly-available key-value store for all cluster data.
*   **kube-scheduler:** Watches for newly created Pods with no assigned node, and selects a node for them to run on.
*   **kube-controller-manager:** Runs controller processes (e.g., Node Controller, Job Controller, EndpointSlice Controller).
*   **cloud-controller-manager:** Integrates with the underlying cloud provider's API to manage cloud-specific resources like load balancers, nodes, and storage.

`coredns` provides DNS services, `kube-proxy` handles network proxying on nodes, and `kubelet` is an agent on nodes; these are not part of the control plane itself but interact with it.

**Question #: 47**
**Topic #: 1**

Which of the following systems is NOT compatible with the CRI runtime interface standard?

A. CRI-0
B. dockershim
C. systemd
D. containerd

**Correct Answer: C**

**Explanation:**
The Container Runtime Interface (CRI) is a plugin interface which enables the kubelet to use a variety of container runtimes.
*   **CRI-O:** A lightweight container runtime specifically for Kubernetes, implementing the CRI.
*   **dockershim:** Was an adapter that allowed Docker Engine to be used as a CRI-compliant runtime (deprecated in Kubernetes v1.20 and removed in v1.24).
*   **containerd:** A high-level container runtime that can function as a CRI runtime.
*   **systemd:** Is an initialization system and service manager for Linux operating systems. It is not a container runtime and does not implement the CRI standard.

## EXAM KCNA TOPIC 1 QUESTION 48 DISCUSSION

**Question #: 48**
**Topic #: 1**

What is a key feature of a container network?

A. Proxying REST requests across a set of containers.
B. Allowing containers running on separate hosts to communicate.
C. Allowing containers on the same host to communicate.
D. Caching remote disk access.

**Correct Answer: B**

**Explanation:**
A key feature of a container network in Kubernetes (or any container orchestration system) is to enable network communication between containers, even when they are running on separate physical hosts (nodes) in the cluster. This is essential for distributed applications and microservices to function properly across a cluster. While enabling communication on the same host (C) is also necessary, cross-host communication (B) is a more critical and complex feature that container networks provide.

## EXAM KCNA TOPIC 1 QUESTION 49 DISCUSSION

**Question #: 49**
**Topic #: 1**

How can you monitor the progress for an updated Deployment/DaemonSets/StatefulSets?

A. kubectl rollout watch
B. kubectl rollout progress
C. kubectl rollout state
D. kubectl rollout status

**Correct Answer: D**

**Explanation:**
The `kubectl rollout status` command is used to monitor the progress of a rollout for Kubernetes resources such as Deployments, DaemonSets, or StatefulSets. It provides real-time updates on whether the rollout is complete, still in progress, or if there are any issues. The option `kubectl rollout watch` is not a standard `kubectl` command.

## EXAM KCNA TOPIC 1 QUESTION 50 DISCUSSION

**Question #: 50**
**Topic #: 1**

What is the goal of load balancing?

A. Automatically measure request performance across instances of an application.
B. Automatically distribute requests across different versions of an application.
C. Automatically distribute instances of an application across the cluster.
D. Automatically distribute requests across instances of an application.

**Correct Answer: D**

**Explanation:**
The primary goal of load balancing is to automatically distribute incoming network traffic (requests) across multiple healthy instances of an application. This helps ensure that no single instance becomes overwhelmed with too many requests, which improves the overall performance, reliability, and availability of the application by distributing the workload efficiently.
