## EXAM KCNA TOPIC 1 QUESTION 59 DISCUSSION

**Question #: 59**
**Topic #: 1**

Services and Pods in Kubernetes are ____ objects.

A. JSON
B. YAML
C. Java
D. REST

**Correct Answer: D**

**Explanation:**
In Kubernetes, resources such as Services and Pods are represented as RESTful objects. This means that they can be accessed and manipulated using HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE via the Kubernetes API server. While configurations for Kubernetes resources are often written in YAML or JSON format, these formats are used to define the desired state of the objects rather than representing the inherent nature of the objects themselves.

## EXAM KCNA TOPIC 1 QUESTION 64 DISCUSSION

**Question #: 64**
**Topic #: 1**

Which of the following is a lightweight tool that manages traffic flows between services, enforces access policies, and aggregates telemetry data, all without requiring changes to application code?

A. NetworkPolicy
B. Linkerd
C. kube-proxy
D. Nginx

**Correct Answer: B**

**Explanation:**
Linkerd is a popular service mesh that is designed to be lightweight and performant. Service meshes (like Linkerd, Istio, Envoy) manage traffic flows between services, enforce access policies, and aggregate telemetry data (metrics, logs, traces) by injecting sidecar proxies next to application containers. This is done transparently, typically without requiring changes to the application code itself.

## EXAM KCNA TOPIC 1 QUESTION 65 DISCUSSION

**Question #: 65**
**Topic #: 1**

Which Kubernetes resource uses `immutable: true` boolean field?

A. Deployment
B. Pod
C. ConfigMap
D. ReplicaSet

**Correct Answer: C**

**Explanation:**
The `ConfigMap` resource (and `Secret` resources) in Kubernetes can use the `immutable: true` boolean field. When set to `true`, this field ensures that the data within the `ConfigMap` (or `Secret`) cannot be updated after the resource is created. This feature helps improve performance and ensures the stability of configuration data.

## EXAM KCNA TOPIC 1 QUESTION 66 DISCUSSION

**Question #: 66**
**Topic #: 1**

Which statement about the Kubernetes network model is correct?

A. Pods can only communicate with Pods exposed via a Service.
B. Pods can communicate with all Pods without NAT.
C. The Pod IP is only visible inside a Pod.
D. The Service IP is used for the communication between Services.

**Correct Answer: B**

**Explanation:**
In the Kubernetes network model, each Pod has a unique IP address, and Pods can communicate with all other Pods directly without needing Network Address Translation (NAT). This principle ensures a flat network topology, simplifying network configuration and management within the Kubernetes cluster.

## EXAM KCNA TOPIC 1 QUESTION 67 DISCUSSION

**Question #: 67**
**Topic #: 1**

What is the resource type used to package sets of containers for scheduling in a cluster?

A. Pod
B. ContainerSet
C. ReplicaSet
D. Deployment

**Correct Answer: A**

**Explanation:**
A Pod is the smallest and simplest deployable unit in the Kubernetes object model. It represents a single instance of a running process in your cluster. A Pod can contain one or more tightly coupled containers that share the same network namespace, IPC namespace, and other resources. Kubernetes deploys, manages, and scales Pods, making them the fundamental unit for scheduling.

## EXAM KCNA TOPIC 1 QUESTION 68 DISCUSSION

**Question #: 68**
**Topic #: 1**

Can a Kubernetes Service expose multiple ports?

A. No, you can only expose one port per each Service.
B. Yes, but you must specify an unambiguous name for each port.
C. Yes, the only requirement is to use different port numbers.
D. No, because the only port you can expose is port number 443.

**Correct Answer: B**

**Explanation:**
A Kubernetes Service can expose multiple ports. When defining a Service with multiple ports, it is a requirement to assign a unique and unambiguous `name` for each port within the `spec.ports` array. This allows the Service to route traffic to different ports on the backend Pods and avoids ambiguity, especially when using protocols that rely on port names (e.g., HTTP/2 or gRPC). While different port numbers are also necessary, the naming ensures clear identification.

Which of the following is a responsibility of the governance board of an open source project?

A. Decide about the marketing strategy of the project.
B. Review the pull requests in the main branch.
C. Outline the project's "terms of engagement".
D. Define the license to be used in the project.

**Correct Answer: C**

**Explanation:**
The governance board of an open source project is responsible for outlining the project's "terms of engagement." This includes defining the rules, guidelines, and processes for how contributors and maintainers interact with the project. These terms ensure that the project operates smoothly, transparently, and inclusively. While defining the license (D) is a critical part of project setup, outlining general terms of engagement is broader and often a primary responsibility for a governance board. Marketing strategy (A) and reviewing individual pull requests (B) are typically handled by other roles or committees.

## EXAM KCNA TOPIC 1 QUESTION 73 DISCUSSION

**Question #: 73**
**Topic #: 1**

What is the role of a NetworkPolicy in Kubernetes?

A. The ability to cryptic and obscure all traffic.
B. The ability to classify the Pods as isolated and non isolated.
C. The ability to prevent loopback or incoming host traffic.
D. The ability to log network security events.

**Correct Answer: B**

**Explanation:**
A NetworkPolicy in Kubernetes is a resource that defines rules for controlling the network traffic to and from Pods. When a NetworkPolicy is applied, it can classify Pods as "isolated," meaning they only accept traffic that matches the specified rules. By default, Pods are "non-isolated" and accept traffic from any source. Thus, the NetworkPolicy's role is to classify Pods as isolated or non-isolated based on defined communication rules.

---

## EXAM KCNA TOPIC 1 QUESTION 74 DISCUSSION

**Question #: 74**
**Topic #: 1**

What are the most important resources to guarantee the performance of an etcd cluster?

A. CPU and disk capacity.
B. Network throughput and disk I/0.
C. CPU and RAM memory.
D. Network throughput and CPU.

**Correct Answer: B**

**Explanation:**
The most important resources to guarantee the performance of an `etcd` cluster are **network throughput and disk I/O**. `etcd` is a distributed key-value store that needs fast and reliable communication between its nodes (high network throughput) and efficient read/write operations to its storage (high disk I/O performance) to maintain responsiveness and data consistency. Consensus performance, especially commit latency, is heavily limited by these two physical constraints.

How to create a headless service?

A. By specifying `.spec.ClusterIP: headless`
B. By specifying `.spec.clusterIP: None`
C. By specifying `.spec.ClusterIP: 0.0.0.0`
D. By specifying `.spec.ClusterIP: localhost`

**Correct Answer: B**

**Explanation:**
To create a Headless Service in Kubernetes, you need to specify `.spec.clusterIP: None` in the Service manifest. This configuration tells Kubernetes not to assign a ClusterIP to the service, allowing clients to directly access the individual Pods' IP addresses via DNS.

## EXAM KCNA TOPIC 1 QUESTION 78 DISCUSSION

**Question #: 78**
**Topic #: 1**

How does dynamic storage provisioning work?

A. A user requests dynamically provisioned storage by including an existing storage class in their PersistentVolumeClaim.
B. An administrator creates a storage class and includes it in their pod YAML definition file without creating a PersistentVolumeClaim.
C. A pod requests dynamically provisioned storage by including a storage class and the pod name in their PersistentVolumeClaim.
D. An administrator creates a PersistentVolume and includes the name of the PersistentVolume in their pod YAML definition file.

**Correct Answer: A**

**Explanation:**
Dynamic storage provisioning in Kubernetes works by allowing users to request storage without needing to pre-provision `PersistentVolume` objects. A user creates a `PersistentVolumeClaim` (PVC) and specifies a `StorageClass` in it. The `StorageClass` then triggers a provisioner to dynamically create a `PersistentVolume` that matches the PVC's requirements.

## EXAM KCNA TOPIC 1 QUESTION 83 DISCUSSION

**Question #: 83**
**Topic #: 1**

Which Kubernetes component is the smallest deployable unit of computing?

A. StatefulSet
B. Deployment
C. Pod
D. Container

**Correct Answer: C**

**Explanation:**
In Kubernetes, the Pod is the smallest deployable unit of computing. A Pod can contain one or more containers, but it is the fundamental unit that Kubernetes deploys, manages, and scales. Containers within a Pod share the same network and storage resources, making the Pod the atomic unit for scheduling and running containers in Kubernetes.

## EXAM KCNA TOPIC 1 QUESTION 86 DISCUSSION

**Question #: 86**
**Topic #: 1**

Which of the following capabilities are you allowed to add to a container using the Restricted policy?

A. CHOWN
B. SYS_CHROOT
C. SETUID
D. NET_BIND_SERVICE

**Correct Answer: D**

**Explanation:**
The Restricted Pod Security Standard in Kubernetes is designed to enforce strict security constraints on containers, typically dropping all capabilities by default. However, it specifically allows the addition of the `NET_BIND_SERVICE` capability. This capability is often needed for containers to bind to network ports below 1024, which are considered privileged. The other capabilities listed (CHOWN, SYS_CHROOT, SETUID) are generally not permitted under the Restricted policy due to security implications.

## EXAM KCNA TOPIC 1 QUESTION 87 DISCUSSION

**Question #: 87**
**Topic #: 1**

What methods can you use to scale a deployment?

A. With kubectl edit deployment exclusively.
B. With kubectl scale-up deployment exclusively.
C. With kubectl scale deployment and kubectl edit deployment.
D. With kubectl scale deployment exclusively.

**Correct Answer: C**

**Explanation:**
You can scale a Kubernetes Deployment using either of the following methods:
*   **`kubectl scale deployment <deployment-name> --replicas=<number>`:** This command allows you to directly specify the desired number of replicas.
*   **`kubectl edit deployment <deployment-name>`:** This command opens the Deployment's configuration in an editor, where you can manually change the `spec.replicas` field.
Both methods effectively achieve the same result by adjusting the number of running instances (replicas) of your application.

## EXAM KCNA TOPIC 1 QUESTION 90 DISCUSSION

**Question #: 90**
**Topic #: 1**

What does vertical scaling an application deployment describe best?

A. The act of adding/removing applications to meet demand.
B. The act of adding/removing node instances to the cluster to meet demand.
C. The act of adding/removing resources to applications to meet demand.
D. The act of adding/removing application instances of the same application to meet demand.

**Correct Answer: C**

**Explanation:**
Vertical scaling an application deployment describes the act of adding or removing resources (such as CPU, memory, or storage) to a *single instance* of an application to meet demand. This approach adjusts the capacity of a single application instance, in contrast to horizontal scaling, which involves adding or removing multiple instances of the application.

## EXAM KCNA TOPIC 1 QUESTION 92 DISCUSSION

**Question #: 92**
**Topic #: 1**

What is Serverless computing?

A. A computing method of providing backend services on an as-used basis.
B. A computing method of providing services for AI and ML operating systems.
C. A computing method of providing services for quantum computing operating systems.
D. A computing method of providing services for cloud computing operating systems.

**Correct Answer: A**

**Explanation:**
Serverless computing is a cloud computing execution model where the cloud provider dynamically manages the allocation and provisioning of servers. In this model, developers build and run applications without having to manage the underlying infrastructure. Instead, they focus on writing code, and the cloud provider handles the execution, scaling, and maintenance of the backend services on an as-used basis, meaning you only pay for the resources consumed when your code is running.

## EXAM KCNA TOPIC 1 QUESTION 96 DISCUSSION

**Question #: 96**
**Topic #: 1**

Which of the following options includes valid API versions?

A. alpha1v1, beta3v3, v2
B. alpha1, beta3, v2
C. v1alpha1, v2beta3, v2
D. v1alpha1, v2beta3, 2.0

**Correct Answer: C**

**Explanation:**
Kubernetes follows a specific convention for API versioning, which includes versions like `v1alpha1`, `v2beta3`, and stable versions like `v1`, `v2`, etc. The format typically consists of a version (`vX`), followed by an optional alpha or beta designation with a version number (e.g., `alpha1`, `beta3`). This structure represents different stages of API stability:
*   `vXalphaY`: Indicates an alpha version (experimental, potentially unstable).
*   `vXbetaY`: Indicates a beta version (more stable but not yet final).
*   `vX`: Indicates a stable, generally available version.
Therefore, `v1alpha1`, `v2beta3`, and `v2` are all valid API version formats.

## EXAM KCNA TOPIC 1 QUESTION 97 DISCUSSION

**Question #: 97**
**Topic #: 1**

Which of the following will view the snapshot of previously terminated ruby container logs from Pod web-1?

A. kubectl logs -p -c ruby web-1
B. kubectl logs -c ruby web-1
C. kubectl logs -p ruby web-1
D. kubectl logs -p -c web-1 ruby

**Correct Answer: A**

**Explanation:**
To view the logs of a previously terminated container within a Pod in Kubernetes, you use the `kubectl logs` command with two flags:
*   `-p` or `--previous`: This flag is used to retrieve logs from a previous instance of a container if it has been restarted.
*   `-c <container-name>` or `--container=<container-name>`: This flag specifies the name of the container within the Pod if there are multiple containers.

The correct command format is `kubectl logs -p -c <container-name> <pod-name>`. Therefore, `kubectl logs -p -c ruby web-1` will show the logs from the previously terminated 'ruby' container in the 'web-1' Pod.

## EXAM KCNA TOPIC 1 QUESTION 99 DISCUSSION

**Question #: 99**
**Topic #: 1**

How many hosts are required to set up a highly available Kubernetes cluster when using an external etcd topology?

A. Four hosts. Two for control plane nodes and two for etcd nodes.
B. Four hosts. One for a control plane node and three for etcd nodes.
C. Three hosts. The control plane nodes and etcd nodes share the same host.
D. Six hosts. Three for control plane nodes and three for etcd nodes.

**Correct Answer: D**

**Explanation:**
For a highly available Kubernetes cluster with an external etcd topology, it's recommended to run a minimum of six hosts:
*   **Three control plane nodes:** To ensure high availability and redundancy for the Kubernetes control plane components (kube-apiserver, kube-scheduler, kube-controller-manager).
*   **Three etcd nodes:** To ensure high availability and data consistency for the etcd cluster. An odd number of etcd nodes (3, 5, etc.) is preferred to maintain a quorum and avoid split-brain scenarios.

## EXAM KCNA TOPIC 1 QUESTION 102 DISCUSSION

**Question #: 102**
**Topic #: 1**

Which resource do you use to attach a volume in a Pod?

A. StorageVolume
B. PersistentVolume
C. StorageClass
D. PersistentVolumeClaim

**Correct Answer: D**

**Explanation:**
In Kubernetes, a `PersistentVolumeClaim` (PVC) is the resource that a Pod uses to request and attach a volume. A PVC is a request for storage by a user. It abstracts the details of the underlying storage infrastructure, allowing users to consume storage resources without needing to know the specifics of how the storage is provisioned. The PVC is then bound to a `PersistentVolume` (PV), which represents the actual storage resource, and the Pod mounts the PVC.

**Question #: 104**
**Topic #: 1**

What Linux namespace is shared by default by containers running within a Kubernetes Pod?

A. Host Network
B. Network
C. Process ID
D. Process Name

**Correct Answer: B**

**Explanation:**
By default, containers running within the same Kubernetes Pod share the **Network** namespace. This means that all containers in a Pod share the same IP address and port space, allowing them to communicate with each other using `localhost` and to coordinate on port usage. This shared network stack enables efficient collaboration and communication between containers in the same Pod.

## EXAM KCNA TOPIC 1 QUESTION 106 DISCUSSION

**Question #: 106**
**Topic #: 1**

What does the "nodeSelector" within a PodSpec use to place Pods on the target nodes?

A. Annotations
B. IP Addresses
C. Hostnames
D. Labels

**Correct Answer: D**

**Explanation:**
The `nodeSelector` field within a PodSpec is used to place Pods on target nodes based on the **labels** assigned to those nodes. `Labels` are key-value pairs that can be attached to Kubernetes objects, including nodes, to provide metadata that can be used for selection and organization. For example, a `nodeSelector` can ensure a Pod runs only on nodes with a specific hardware type by matching a label like `disktype: ssd`.

## EXAM KCNA TOPIC 1 QUESTION 107 DISCUSSION

**Question #: 107**
**Topic #: 1**

What do Deployments and StatefulSets have in common?

A. They manage Pods that are based on an identical container spec.
B. They support the OnDelete update strategy.
C. They support an ordered, graceful deployment and scaling.
D. They maintain a sticky identity for each of their Pods.

**Correct Answer: A**

**Explanation:**
Both Deployments and StatefulSets in Kubernetes manage Pods that are based on an identical container specification (`PodTemplateSpec`). This means that the Pods managed by either a Deployment or a StatefulSet are created from the same template, ensuring consistency in the container images, environment variables, volumes, and other configurations.
While StatefulSets do offer ordered, graceful deployment/scaling and maintain sticky identities (C and D), Deployments primarily focus on stateless applications and provide declarative updates without strict ordering or unique identities for individual Pods.

**Topic #: 1**

Which of the following best describes horizontally scaling an application deployment?

A. The act of adding/removing node instances to the cluster to meet demand.
B. The act of adding/removing applications to meet demand.
C. The act of adding/removing application instances of the same application to meet demand.
D. The act of adding/removing resources to application instances to meet demand.

**Correct Answer: C**

**Explanation:**
Horizontally scaling an application deployment involves adding or removing *instances* (replicas) of the same application to meet demand. This is in contrast to vertical scaling, which involves adding or removing resources (like CPU, memory) to a *single instance* of an application.

## EXAM KCNA TOPIC 1 QUESTION 113 DISCUSSION

**Question #: 113**
**Topic #: 1**

How many different Kubernetes service types can you define?

A. 2
B. 3
C. 4
D. 5

**Correct Answer: C**

**Explanation:**
Kubernetes supports four different core Service types:
1.  **ClusterIP:** The default type, exposes the Service on a cluster-internal IP, making it only reachable from within the cluster.
2.  **NodePort:** Exposes the Service on each Node's IP at a static port, making it accessible from outside the cluster via `<NodeIP>:<NodePort>`.
3.  **LoadBalancer:** Exposes the Service externally using a cloud provider's load balancer, typically provisioning an external IP address.
4.  **ExternalName:** Maps the Service to the contents of the `externalName` field (e.g., `foo.example.com`) by returning a CNAME record, redirecting traffic to an external service outside the Kubernetes cluster.
A Headless Service is a variation of a ClusterIP Service (by setting `spec.clusterIP: None`), not a distinct Service type.

## EXAM KCNA TOPIC 1 QUESTION 114 DISCUSSION

**Question #: 114**
**Topic #: 1**

What is the difference between a Deployment and a ReplicaSet?

A. With a Deployment, you can't control the number of pod replicas.
B. A ReplicaSet does not guarantee a stable set of replica pods running.
C. A Deployment is basically the same as a ReplicaSet with annotations.
D. A Deployment is a higher-level concept that manages ReplicaSets.

**Correct Answer: D**

**Explanation:**
A Deployment is a higher-level abstraction that manages ReplicaSets and provides declarative updates to applications (e.g., rolling updates, rollbacks). A ReplicaSet, on the other hand, is a lower-level controller that ensures a specified number of identical Pod replicas are running at all times. Deployments use ReplicaSets to achieve their desired state.

The Container Runtime Interface (CRI) defines the protocol for the communication between:

A. The kubelet and the container runtime.
B. The container runtime and etcd.
C. The kube-apiserver and the kubelet.
D. The container runtime and the image registry.

**Correct Answer: A**

**Explanation:**
The Container Runtime Interface (CRI) defines the protocol for communication between the **kubelet** and the **container runtime** (e.g., containerd, CRI-O). The CRI allows Kubernetes to support different container runtimes in a consistent manner by providing a standard interface for the kubelet to interact with the container runtime.

**Question #: 116**
**Topic #: 1**

Which authorization-mode allows granular control over the operations that different entities can perform on different objects in a Kubernetes cluster?

A. Webhook Mode Authorization Control
B. Role Based Access Control
C. Node Authorization Access Control
D. Attribute Based Access Control

**Correct Answer: B**

**Explanation:**
**Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** is an authorization mode in Kubernetes that provides fine-grained control over the actions that users, groups, and service accounts can perform on various resources within the cluster. RBAC allows administrators to define roles (sets of permissions) and role bindings (assigning roles to users or service accounts) to specify permissions for different entities.

Which of the following is a correct definition of a Helm chart?

A. A Helm chart is a collection of YAML files bundled in a tar.gz file and can be applied without decompressing it.
B. A Helm chart is a collection of JSON files and contains all the resource definitions to run an application on Kubernetes.
C. A Helm chart is a collection of YAML files that can be applied on Kubernetes by using the kubectl tool.
D. A Helm chart is similar to a package and contains all the resource definitions to run an application on Kubernetes.

**Correct Answer: D**

**Explanation:**
A Helm chart is a package format used by Helm, a package manager for Kubernetes. Helm charts contain all the necessary resource definitions to deploy and manage an application on a Kubernetes cluster. These resource definitions are typically written in YAML and include templates for Kubernetes objects such as Deployments, Services, ConfigMaps, and more. They serve as a template for applications, enabling repeatable installations, upgrades, and rollbacks of services in various environments.

**Question #: 118**
**Topic #: 1**

Which of the following sentences is true about namespaces in Kubernetes?

A. You can create a namespace within another namespace in Kubernetes.
B. You can create two resources of the same kind and name in a namespace.
C. The default namespace exists when a new cluster is created.
D. All the objects in the cluster are namespaced by default.

**Correct Answer: C**

**Explanation:**
When a new Kubernetes cluster is created, the `default` namespace (along with `kube-system`, `kube-public`, and `kube-node-lease`) automatically exists. You cannot create a namespace within another namespace (A). You cannot create two resources of the same kind and name *within the same namespace* (B), as names must be unique per resource type within a namespace. Not all objects are namespaced by default; some cluster-level resources are not (D).

**Question #: 119**
**Topic #: 1**

How does Horizontal Pod autoscaling work in Kubernetes?

A. The Horizontal Pod Autoscaler controller adds more CPU or memory to the pods when the load is above the configured threshold, and reduces CPU or memory when the load is below.
B. The Horizontal Pod Autoscaler controller adds more pods when the load is above the configured threshold, but does not reduce the number of pods when the load is below.
C. The Horizontal Pod Autoscaler controller adds more pods to the specified DaemonSet when the load is above the configured threshold, and reduces the number of pods when the load is below.
D. The Horizontal Pod Autoscaler controller adds more pods when the load is above the configured threshold, and reduces the number of pods when the load is below.

**Correct Answer: D**

**Explanation:**
The Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) in Kubernetes automatically adjusts the number of Pod replicas (instances) in a Deployment, ReplicaSet, or StatefulSet based on observed metrics such as CPU utilization, memory usage, or custom metrics. The HPA ensures that the number of running Pods matches the current demand, scaling up (adding more Pods) when the load is high and scaling down (reducing the number of Pods) when the load is low.

What is a Pod?

A. A networked application within Kubernetes.
B. A storage volume within Kubernetes.
C. A single container within Kubernetes.
D. A group of one or more containers within Kubernetes.

**Correct Answer: D**

**Explanation:**
In Kubernetes, a Pod is the smallest deployable unit of computing. A Pod represents a single instance of a running process in your cluster and can contain a group of one or more tightly coupled containers that share resources like network namespace, IPC namespace, and storage.

What is the Kubernetes object used for running a recurring workload?

A. Job
B. Batch
C. DaemonSet
D. CronJob

**Correct Answer: D**

**Explanation:**
A `CronJob` is the Kubernetes object used for running recurring workloads. It allows you to schedule a `Job` (which creates Pods to execute a task) to run at specified intervals using cron expressions, similar to the `cron` utility in Unix-like operating systems. This makes it suitable for tasks such as periodic data backups, scheduled report generation, or other automated, time-based operations.
