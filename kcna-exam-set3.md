**Question #: 182**
**Topic #: 1**

Which Kubernetes-native deployment strategy supports zero-downtime updates of a workload?

A. Canary
B. Recreate
C. BlueGreen
D. RollingUpdate

**Correct Answer: D**

**Explanation:**
`RollingUpdate` is the Kubernetes-native deployment strategy that supports zero-downtime updates of a workload. It gradually updates Pod instances with new ones, ensuring that a sufficient number of old Pods remain available while new ones are being deployed and verified. This allows for continuous availability during updates. Canary and Blue/Green are more advanced deployment patterns often built on top of `RollingUpdate` or other Kubernetes primitives, but `RollingUpdate` is the core native strategy for zero-downtime.

## EXAM KCNA TOPIC 1 QUESTION 186 DISCUSSION

**Question #: 186**
**Topic #: 1**

Which of the following options include resources cleaned by the Kubernetes garbage collection mechanism?

A. Stale or expired CertificateSigning Requests (CSRs) and old deployments.
B. Nodes deleted by a cloud controller manager and obsolete logs from the kubelet.
C. Unused container and container images, and obsolete logs from the kubelet.
D. Terminated pods, completed jobs, and objects without owner references.

**Correct Answer: D**

**Explanation:**
Kubernetes garbage collection automatically cleans up certain resources that are no longer needed. This typically includes:
*   **Terminated Pods:** Pods that have completed their lifecycle (Succeeded or Failed state).
*   **Completed Jobs:** Jobs that have finished their execution.
*   **Objects without owner references:** Resources that do not have an owner reference (e.g., a ReplicaSet owning Pods) will often be garbage collected if they are no longer referenced by another object.

While other options mention components or logs, terminated Pods, completed Jobs, and unreferenced objects are direct targets of Kubernetes' core garbage collection.

## EXAM KCNA TOPIC 1 QUESTION 187 DISCUSSION

**Question #: 187**
**Topic #: 1**

What is the default eviction timeout when the Ready condition of a node is Unknown or False?

A. Thirty seconds.
B. Thirty minutes.
C. One minute.
D. Five minutes.

**Correct Answer: D**

**Explanation:**
The default eviction timeout when the Ready condition of a node is Unknown or False is **five minutes**. If a node's readiness state becomes unhealthy (Unknown or False), Kubernetes waits for a default period of five minutes before initiating the eviction of Pods from that node. This delay provides a grace period for transient network issues or node recovery.

## EXAM KCNA TOPIC 1 QUESTION 190 DISCUSSION

**Question #: 190**
**Topic #: 1**

Which two elements are shared between containers in the same pod?

A. Network resources and liveness probes.
B. Storage and container image registry.
C. Storage and network resources.
D. Network resources and Dockerfiles.

**Correct Answer: C**

**Explanation:**
Containers within the same Kubernetes Pod share:
*   **Network resources:** They share the same network namespace, meaning they have the same IP address and can communicate with each other using `localhost`.
*   **Storage resources:** They can access shared volumes defined within the Pod, allowing them to share data.

Liveness probes (A) are configured per container but are not a shared resource *between* containers in the same sense as network and storage. Dockerfiles (D) are used to build images, not shared at runtime. A container image registry (B) is external.

## EXAM KCNA TOPIC 1 QUESTION 191 DISCUSSION

**Question #: 191**
**Topic #: 1**

In Kubernetes, if the API version of feature is `v2beta3`, it means that:

A. The version will remain available for all future releases within a Kubernetes major version.
B. The API may change in incompatible ways in a later software release without notice.
C. The software is well tested. Enabling a feature is considered safe.
D. The software may contain bugs. Enabling a feature may expose bugs.

**Correct Answer: B**

**Explanation:**
In Kubernetes API versioning:
*   `alpha` versions (e.g., `v1alpha1`) are experimental, may be buggy, and can change incompatibly without notice.
*   `beta` versions (e.g., `v2beta3`) are well-tested but may still contain bugs. More importantly, the API *may change in incompatible ways in a later software release without notice*. While breaking changes are less frequent than in alpha, they are still possible. Enabling a beta feature is generally considered safe for non-critical workloads, but production use requires caution and monitoring for potential breaking changes in future minor releases.
*   Stable versions (e.g., `v1`, `v2`) are considered robust and stable, with backward compatibility guarantees.

Therefore, for a `beta` version like `v2beta3`, the key implication is that the API *may change in incompatible ways in a later software release without notice.*

## EXAM KCNA TOPIC 1 QUESTION 192 DISCUSSION

**Question #: 192**
**Topic #: 1**

What is the API that exposes resource metrics from the metrics-server?

A. custom.k8s.io
B. resources.k8s.io
C. metrics.k8s.io
D. cadvisor.k8s.io

**Correct Answer: B**

**Explanation:**
The Metrics Server exposes resource metrics (CPU and memory utilization) for Pods and Nodes through the **`metrics.k8s.io`** API. This API is used by the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) and `kubectl top` to gather resource usage information. `custom.k8s.io` is for custom metrics, and `resources.k8s.io` is not the standard API for core resource metrics from the Metrics Server.

## EXAM KCNA TOPIC 1 QUESTION 195 DISCUSSION

**Question #: 195**
**Topic #: 1**

Which of the following is a recommended security habit in Kubernetes?

A. Run the containers as the user with group ID 0 (root) and any user ID.
B. Disallow privilege escalation from within a container as the default option.
C. Run the containers as the user with user ID 0 (root) and any group ID.
D. Allow privilege escalation from within a container as the default option.

**Correct Answer: B**

**Explanation:**
A recommended security habit in Kubernetes is to **disallow privilege escalation from within a container as the default option**. This is a critical security measure to prevent a compromised container from gaining higher privileges on the host system. Running containers as non-root users and preventing privilege escalation are fundamental principles of secure container operation. Options A and C promote running as root, which is a security risk. Option D explicitly allows privilege escalation, which is the opposite of a recommended security practice.

## EXAM KCNA TOPIC 1 QUESTION 135 DISCUSSION

**Question #: 135**
**Topic #: 1**

What's the difference between a security profile and a security context?

A. Security Contexts configure Clusters and Namespaces at runtime. Security profiles are control plane mechanisms to enforce specific settings in the Security Context.
B. Security Contexts configure Pods and Containers at runtime. Security profiles are control plane mechanisms to enforce specific settings in the Security Context.
C. Security Profiles configure Pods and Containers at runtime. Security Contexts are control plane mechanisms to enforce specific settings in the Security Profile.
D. Security Profiles configure Clusters and Namespaces at runtime. Security Contexts are control plane mechanisms to enforce specific settings in the Security Profile.

**Correct Answer: B**

**Explanation:**
*   **Security Contexts** define the security settings for a Pod or a Container at runtime. They specify security-related attributes that should be applied to the Pod or container, such as running as a non-root user, privilege escalation settings, capabilities, and SELinux options.
*   **Security Profiles** (such as Pod Security Standards or custom Admission Controllers) are control plane mechanisms that enforce specific security settings (often by validating or mutating a Pod's Security Context) across a cluster or namespace. They define *what* security contexts are allowed or required.

A. A portable operating system.
B. File system redundancy.
C. A container image registry.
D. Automated rollouts and rollbacks.

**Correct Answer: D**

**Explanation:**
As a container orchestration tool, Kubernetes provides **automated rollouts and rollbacks** by default. Deployments, for example, manage the process of updating applications by gradually replacing old Pods with new ones (rolling update) and can revert to a previous stable version if an issue occurs (rollback).
*   A portable operating system (A) is a feature of containers themselves, not Kubernetes.
*   File system redundancy (B) and a container image registry (C) are typically external services or features provided by storage solutions and container registries, respectively, although Kubernetes integrates with them.

## EXAM KCNA TOPIC 1 QUESTION 139 DISCUSSION

**Question #: 139**
**Topic #: 1**

Which of the following sentences is true about container runtimes in Kubernetes?

A. If you let iptables see bridged traffic, you don't need a container runtime.
B. If you enable IPv4 forwarding, you don't need a container runtime.
C. Container runtimes are deprecated, you must install CRI on each node
D. You must install a container runtime on each node to run pods on it.

**Correct Answer: D**

**Explanation:**
You **must install a container runtime on each node to run Pods on it**. The container runtime (e.g., containerd, CRI-O) is the software component responsible for actually running and managing containers on a node. The `kubelet` on each node interacts with this runtime via the Container Runtime Interface (CRI) to manage the lifecycle of Pods and their containers. Without a container runtime, Pods cannot be executed on a node.

## EXAM KCNA TOPIC 1 QUESTION 140 DISCUSSION

**Question #: 140**
**Topic #: 1**

If a Pod was waiting for container images to download on the scheduled node, what state would it be in?

A. Failed
B. Succeeded
C. Unknown
D. Pending

**Correct Answer: D**

**Explanation:**
When a Pod is created in Kubernetes and is waiting for container images to be downloaded (pulled) to the scheduled node, it will be in the **Pending** state. The Pending state indicates that the Pod has been accepted by the Kubernetes system, but one or more of its containers have not yet been started. This can happen for reasons such as waiting for image pulls, volume mounts, or sufficient node resources.

## EXAM KCNA TOPIC 1 QUESTION 143 DISCUSSION

**Question #: 143**
**Topic #: 1**

Imagine you're releasing open-source software for the first time. Which of the following is a valid semantic version?

Α. 1.0
Β. 2021-10-11
C. 0.1.0-rc
D. v1beta1

**Correct Answer: C**

**Explanation:**
Semantic Versioning (often referred to as SemVer) follows the format `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` with optional pre-release and build metadata.
*   `MAJOR` version when you make incompatible API changes.
*   `MINOR` version when you add functionality in a backward-compatible manner.
*   `PATCH` version when you make backward-compatible bug fixes.
*   Pre-release identifiers (e.g., `-rc`, `-alpha`, `-beta`) can be appended.

Given the options:
*   A. `1.0` is a valid semantic version.
*   B. `2021-10-11` is a date, not a semantic version.
*   C. `0.1.0-rc` is a valid semantic version, indicating a release candidate for a 0.1.0 version. This is typical for early releases where the API might not be stable yet (0.Y.Z releases can include breaking changes in the MINOR version).
*   D. `v1beta1` is a Kubernetes API versioning convention, not standard semantic versioning.

Since the question asks for "a valid semantic version," and `0.1.0-rc` perfectly aligns with the specification for a pre-release version of an initial minor release, it is the most appropriate answer among the choices that use semantic versioning style.

## EXAM KCNA TOPIC 1 QUESTION 155 DISCUSSION

**Question #: 155**
**Topic #: 1**

Manual reclamation policy of a PVC resource is known as:

A. claimRef
B. Delete
C. Retain
D. Recycle

**Correct Answer: C**

**Explanation:**
In Kubernetes, the reclamation policy of a `PersistentVolume` (PV) determines what happens to the underlying storage resource when its `PersistentVolumeClaim` (PVC) is deleted. The policies are:
*   **Retain:** This is the manual reclamation policy. The PV and its underlying storage resource are not deleted; they remain in place. An administrator must manually reclaim or reuse the volume and its data.
*   **Delete:** The PV and its underlying storage resource are automatically deleted when the PVC is deleted.
*   **Recycle:** (Deprecated) This policy used to wipe data from the volume and make it available for new PVCs, but it is no longer recommended and is often replaced by dynamic provisioning.

Therefore, the manual reclamation policy is known as **Retain**.

**Question #: 161**
**Topic #: 1**

Which of these is a valid container restart policy?

A. On login
B. On update
C. On start
D. On failure

**Correct Answer: D**

**Explanation:**
In Kubernetes, a container restart policy defines the conditions under which a container should be restarted. There are three valid restart policies for containers in Kubernetes (defined at the Pod level):
*   **Always:** The container will always be restarted if it stops, regardless of the exit status.
*   **OnFailure:** The container will be restarted only if it exits with a non-zero exit status (indicating a failure).
*   **Never:** The container will not be restarted, regardless of the exit status.

Therefore, **OnFailure** is a valid container restart policy.

**Question #: 164**
**Topic #: 1**

Which statement about Secrets is correct?

A. A Secret is part of a Pod specification.
B. Secrets data is encrypted with the cluster private key by default.
C. Secrets data is base64 encoded and stored unencrypted by default
D. A Secret can only be used for confidential data

**Correct Answer: C**

**Explanation:**
The correct statement about Kubernetes Secrets is that **Secrets data is base64 encoded and stored unencrypted by default**. It's crucial to understand that base64 encoding is not encryption; it's a reversible encoding scheme. While Secrets are *intended* for confidential data (D), they do not provide encryption at rest by default without additional configuration (e.g., Encryption at Rest for `etcd` or external secrets management solutions). Secrets are referenced by Pods but are not *part of* a Pod specification (A) themselves; they are separate API objects.

**Question #: 168**
**Topic #: 1**

If kubectl is failing to retrieve information from the cluster, where can you find pod logs to troubleshoot?

A. /var/log/pods/
B. ~/.kube/config
C. /var/log/k8s/
D. /etc/kubernetes/

**Correct Answer: A**

**Explanation:**
If `kubectl` is failing to retrieve information, you would typically look at the underlying node for logs. Pod logs are usually stored on the node where the Pod is running, often under the directory `/var/log/pods/`. Each Pod typically has a directory there, containing log files for its containers.
*   `~/.kube/config` (B) is your client-side configuration file for `kubectl`.
*   `/var/log/k8s/` (C) is not a standard Kubernetes log directory.
*   `/etc/kubernetes/` (D) contains cluster configuration files, not Pod logs.

**Question #: 169**
**Topic #: 1**

Which component in Kubernetes is responsible to watch newly created Pods with no assigned node, and selects a node for them to run on?

A. etcd
B. kube controller-manager
C. kube proxy
D. kube scheduler

**Correct Answer: D**

**Explanation:**
The **kube-scheduler** is the Kubernetes component responsible for watching newly created Pods that have no assigned node. It then selects an optimal node for them to run on, considering factors like resource requirements, policies, affinity/anti-affinity rules, taints/tolerations, and inter-Pod workloads.
*   `etcd` (A) is the distributed key-value store.
*   `kube-controller-manager` (B) runs various controllers but not the scheduler.
*   `kube-proxy` (C) handles network proxying for Services.

**Topic #: 1**

Which control plane component is responsible for updating the node Ready condition if a node becomes unreachable?

A. The kube-oroxy.
B. The node controller.
C. The kubelct.
D. The kube-apiserver

**Correct Answer: B**

**Explanation:**
The **node controller** (part of the `kube-controller-manager`) is the control plane component responsible for updating the node `Ready` condition if a node becomes unreachable. It monitors the health of nodes and is responsible for detecting node failures, marking nodes as unhealthy, and initiating Pod eviction from unreachable nodes after a configurable timeout.

Which are the core features provided by a service mesh?

A. Authentication and authorization
B. Distributing and replicating data
C. Security vulnerability scanning
D. Configuration management

**Correct Answer: A**

**Explanation:**
Core features provided by a service mesh include:
*   **Traffic Management:** Intelligent routing, load balancing, retries, and timeouts.
*   **Observability:** Metrics, logs, and traces for inter-service communication.
*   **Security:** This includes **Authentication and authorization** (e.g., mutual TLS between services), policy enforcement, and access control.

Distributing and replicating data (B) is typically handled by stateful applications or storage systems. Security vulnerability scanning (C) is a separate security practice. Configuration management (D) is broader than just a service mesh, though a service mesh has its own specific configuration.

## EXAM KCNA TOPIC 1 QUESTION 174 DISCUSSION

**Question #: 174**
**Topic #: 1**

Which of the following options include only mandatory fields to create a Kubernetes object using a YAML file?

A. apiVersion, template, kind, status
B. apiVersion, metadata, status, spec
C. apiVersion, template, kind, spec
D. apiVersion, metadata, kind, spec

**Correct Answer: D**

**Explanation:**
To create any Kubernetes object using a YAML file, the following top-level fields are mandatory:
*   **`apiVersion`**: Specifies the Kubernetes API version.
*   **`kind`**: Specifies the type of Kubernetes object (e.g., `Pod`, `Deployment`).
*   **`metadata`**: Contains object metadata like `name`, `labels`, and `annotations`.
*   **`spec`**: Describes the desired state of the object.

Other fields like `template` (used within Deployment/ReplicaSet spec) and `status` (populated by Kubernetes itself) are not universally mandatory top-level fields for *creating* an object.

Which of the following is the name of a container orchestration software?

A. OpenStack
B. Docker
C. Apache Mesos
D. CRI-O

**Correct Answer: C**

**Explanation:**
**Apache Mesos** is a distributed systems kernel that can be used for resource management and also supports container orchestration. While Kubernetes is the dominant container orchestrator today, Apache Mesos was a notable container orchestration software.
*   `OpenStack` (A) is a cloud operating system.
*   `Docker` (B) primarily refers to the container engine and platform, not solely an orchestrator.
*   `CRI-O` (D) is a container runtime, not an orchestrator.

## EXAM KCNA TOPIC 1 QUESTION 176 DISCUSSION

**Question #: 176**
**Topic #: 1**

What happens with a regular pod running in Kubernetes when a node fails?

A. A new pod with the same UID is scheduled to another node after a while.
B. A new, near-identical pod but with different UID is scheduled to another node.
C. By default, a pod can only be scheduled to the same node when the node fails.
D. A new pod is scheduled on a different node only if it is configured explicitly.

**Correct Answer: B**

**Explanation:**
When a node fails, Kubernetes' control plane (specifically the node controller and scheduler) detects the node's unhealthy state. If the Pod was managed by a controller (like a Deployment or ReplicaSet), that controller will notice the desired state is not met (fewer running Pods than desired). It will then create a new Pod (which will have a **different UID**) and the scheduler will attempt to schedule it on a healthy node. The original Pod on the failed node is eventually terminated and garbage collected.

## EXAM KCNA TOPIC 1 QUESTION 177 DISCUSSION

**Question #: 177**
**Topic #: 1**

What is the minimum of etcd members that are required for a highly available Kubernetes cluster?

A. Two etcd members.
B. Five etcd members.
C. Six etcd members.
D. Three etcd members

**Correct Answer: D**

**Explanation:**
For a highly available `etcd` cluster, a minimum of **three etcd members** is required. `etcd` uses a Raft-based consensus algorithm, which requires a quorum (a majority) of members to agree on decisions. For 3 members, a quorum is 2. For 5 members, a quorum is 3. An odd number of members is recommended to maintain quorum and tolerate failures, and 3 is the smallest odd number that provides resilience (tolerating 1 failure). While 5 members (B) offer more fault tolerance, the *minimum* for high availability is 3.

What is the main purpose of the Ingress in Kubernetes?

A. Access HTTP and HTTPS services running in the cluster based on their IP address.
B. Access services different from HTTP or HTTPS running in the cluster based on their IP address.
C. Access services different from HTTP or HTTPS running in the cluster based on their path
D. Access HTTP and HTTPS services running in the cluster based on their path.

**Correct Answer: D**

**Explanation:**
The main purpose of **Ingress** in Kubernetes is to manage external access to HTTP and HTTPS services within a cluster. It provides HTTP and HTTPS routing to services based on rules defined by hostnames, paths, or other criteria. This allows for unified routing of external traffic to multiple services.

## EXAM KCNA TOPIC 1 QUESTION 179 DISCUSSION

**Question #: 179**
**Topic #: 1**

How can you extend the Kubernetes API?

A. Adding a Custom Resource Definition or implementing an aggregation layer.
B. Adding a new version of a resource, for instance v4beta3.
C. With the command kubectl extend api, logged in as an administrator.
D. Adding the desired API object as a kubelet parameter

**Correct Answer: A**

**Explanation:**
The Kubernetes API can be extended in two primary ways:
1.  **Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs):** This is the most common way, allowing users to define custom resources that behave like native Kubernetes objects.
2.  **API Aggregation Layer:** This allows you to extend the Kubernetes API with a custom API server that serves specific API resources. This custom API server then aggregates its API into the main Kubernetes API server.

Adding a new version of an *existing* resource (B) is part of API evolution, not a way to extend the API with new types. `kubectl extend api` (C) is not a standard command. Adding an API object as a `kubelet` parameter (D) is incorrect; `kubelet` parameters are for configuring the node agent, not extending the API.

## EXAM KCNA TOPIC 1 QUESTION 180 DISCUSSION

**Question #: 180**
**Topic #: 1**

What is an ephemeral container?

A. A specialized container that runs as root for infosec applications.
B. A specialized container that runs temporarily in an existing Pod.
C. A specialized container that extends and enhances the 'main' container in a Pod
D. A specialized container that run before app container in a Pod

**Correct Answer: B**

**Explanation:**
An **ephemeral container** is a specialized container type in Kubernetes that runs *temporarily in an existing Pod*. Unlike regular init containers or main application containers, ephemeral containers are typically used for interactive troubleshooting, debugging, or inspecting a running Pod's environment without restarting or altering its primary application containers. They do not get resourced or scheduled like regular containers and are attached to a running Pod for a short duration.
